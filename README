Special Note: UPM-Android is a really wonderful work of code.
It also has many great features such as sync across devices.
I wanted to adapt UPM-Android to be a niche use product for use
on obsolete Android Devices that would have been discarded when
a user upgrades to a new device. To that end, I wanted to disable
some feature and make some operational/visual changes. 
I hope you enjoy some of the changes I have made ^^;;

Originally I got the idea of a dead simple device to use
because my wife is horrible at keeping good passwords,
however, with how phones are and the endless options out there
it just become to overwhelming to know whats what. 

I suspect even my parents could use a single use device that
utilizes a simple and effecient password manager. If my parents
then possibly countless others.

UPM - Epassafe
--------------------------
http://www.epassafe.com

UPM - Epassafe (C) 2013 is a fork of Universal Password Manager (UPM) with the
development geared to making this a stand-alone application on an Android Device.

UPM - Epassafe differs from Universal Password Manager in several ways. It has been
stripped down to the most basic usage, that of encrypting your passwords and allowing
backups to be made to external device i.e sdcard. Also, this program fork has been designed
to be the sole application to run aside from the most basic android specific applications.

For example, Epassafe replaces the default Launcher. 
I believe their is a niche market for requiring this kind of device.

Apart from how Epassafe differs from Universal Password Manager, the aim is to use it on a
modified Android OS or special Rom to make the device sole purpose for keeping passwords
safe, like a notebook but in electronic form.  

History
-------
v.2.0 - Out of Beta (6 Years Later o.O)
            Updated for Android v9.0+ (Q, PIE) 2019.
            Updated Build API from 16 to 29.0.1.
            Adjusted lockout to 1 hour - very annoying having it auto-lock so quickly. 
            Code Clean up.
            
v.1.9b Beta - Changed lockout to 5 mins, added screen keep alive to fix issue of timer not working when phone sleeps.
v.1.8b Beta - Replaced Master Password Warning Text with Logo. (Just don't forget your password!)
			  Added 10 minute timer to lockout. So no more worries if you forget to lock the app.
v.1.7b Beta - Created an Automatic Backup aupm.db from Manual Backup upm.db on application exit
				--Restore still from Manual Backup file upm.db
				--If want to restore automatic backup, must rename aupm.db --> upm.db from root of sdCard
					(This makes good practice to do manual backups in the first place, but leaves a safety net
					for just in case i.e. database corruption)
v.1.6b Beta - Added Password Generator (https://github.com/rod86/PassGenerator)
v.1.5b Beta - Code Clean Up
v.1.4b Beta - Added Quick Lock with Volume Down (Temp until figure out with Screen Off)
