UPM - Epassafe
--------------------------
UPM - Epassafe (C) 2013 is a fork of Universal Password Manager (UPM) with the
development geared to making this a stand-alone application on an Android Device.

UPM - Epassafe differs from Universal Password Manager in several ways. It has been
stripped down to the most basic usage, that of encrypting your passwords and allowing
backups to be made to external device i.e sdcard.
