Some of the Changes I've made:

- Made the program into a Home Launcher
- Icon
- Name Modification to differintiate between the Forks
- Visual Changes
	-- View Account: Smaller Text, and Visual Fields
	-- View List: One Click Add Account Button on Menu Bar
- Disabled Internet Access
- Disabled Sync to outside sources
- Changed Context Menu Options
- Changed Home Button Options
- Added Quick Lock with Volume Down (Temp until figure out with Screen Off)
- Easter Egg
- Added Password Generator (https://github.com/rod86/PassGenerator)
- Created an Automatic Backup "aupm.db" (generated in Android's root) from Manual Backup upm.db on application exit
	-- Restore still from Manual Backup file upm.db
	-- If want to restore automatic backup, must rename aupm.db --> upm.db from root of sdCard
		(This makes good practice to do manual backups in the first place, but leaves a safety net
		for just in case i.e. database corruption)
- Placed logo on Master Password page in place of text.
- Automatically Lock after 1 hour (Just in case forget to lock while away.)

Some things I would like to add:

- Long Press Delete Account from context menu
- Theme Options / Like change colors, maybe add background picture
